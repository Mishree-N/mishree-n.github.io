                    Hello, I'm Mishree Narasaiah, a first-year Neuroscience major on the pre-medical track at the
                    University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
                    Having previously lived in India, Denmark, Singapore, and California, I came to Chapel Hill from
                    Austin, Texas, my most recent home. Having graduated from Westwood High School where I completed the
                    International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP), I bring a diverse perspective to the table. As
                    part of the IBDP program, I explored my esoteric interests in science and research while becoming
                    involved in clinical internships as part of my career exploration activities.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Specifically, for my extended essay in biology, I conducted research on the most efficacious contact
                    lens cleaning solution in order to prevent bacterial eye infections that manifest as a result of
                    improper usage and cleaning. Consequently, I gained the skill of research design, proper laboratory
                    etiquette, and research paper writing. To further my exposure in the field of scientific research, I
                    submitted this paper to the International Young Researchers’ Conference, a program hosted by
                    Columbia University. Since my manuscript was accepted, I was invited to present at the University in
                    December 2024, developing scientific poster creation and presentation skills during this process.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Additionally, as part of my diploma programme, I conducted independent research in behavioral
                    biology, working with two species of snails in a maze-navigation experiment I crafted to understand
                    pheromone-based communication via mucin trails. As a result, I gained research experience working
                    with live organisms and learned how to handle and care for them ethically.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    To further explore my interests in the healthcare field, I interned at dental and ophthalmology
                    clinics in Austin. During these two experiences, I discovered my interest in neuro-ophthalmology, a
                    field I am currently looking forward to pursuing as a physician. Working with patients in these
                    settings also helped me reinforce my desire to pursue a medical degree. Specifically, viewing the
                    doctors I shadowed interact with their patients to create a diagnosis and then treat them with tact
                    and empathy confirmed that I hope to be in that position one day.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Currently, at UNC, I am part of the Remote Area Medical Community Host Group committee, where I work
                    to help establish a local clinic in Chapel Hill with physicians and student volunteers on site.
                    Furthermore, I am involved in research at the Hantman Lab in the Neuroscience Center of UNC’s
                    medical school, where I research the neural mechanisms of skilled motor control post-stroke recovery
                    in mice using optogenetics. I am also pursuing a Neuroscience degree on the pre-medical path with
                    hopes to one day attend an MD/PhD program, where I can continue pursuing my combined passion in
                    research and medicine.
