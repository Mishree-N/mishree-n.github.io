                        Welcome! I am Mishree Narasaiah, a freshman at UNC pursuing a Neuroscience, B.S. degree on
                        the
                        pre-medical path. Post-graduation, I hope to attend an MD/PhD program, where I plan to
                        continue
                        pursuing my commitment to scientific research and medicine. Having previously lived in
                        India,
                        Denmark, Singapore, and California, I came to Chapel Hill from my
                        most recent home in Austin, Texas. In Austin, I completed the International Baccalaureate
                        Diploma
                        Program (IBDP), exploring my esoteric interests in science and research as part of my
                        coursework.

                        </br>
                        </br>
                        Specifically, for my long-term research project in biology, I conducted research on the most
                        efficacious contact lens cleaning solution in order to prevent bacterial eye infections
                        caused
                        by
                        <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> that can manifest as a result of
                        improper
                        usage and cleaning.
                        Consequently, I gained the skill of research design by crafting my own study, learned how to
                        implement the aseptic technique, and wrote my first full <a

                        findings.
                        As
                        a
                        result of this experience, I was able to submit my paper to the International Young
                        Researchers’
                        Conference, a program hosted by Columbia University. After learning about my manuscript’s
                        acceptance, I also designed a <a

                        Additionally, as part of the IBDP, I conducted independent research in behavioral biology,
                        working
                        with <span class="italic">Otala lactea</span> and <span class="italic">Bulimulus
                            guadalupensis</span>, two species of snails, in a maze-navigation
                        experiment I crafted to understand pheromone-based communication via mucin trails. As a
                        result,
                        I
                        gained experience working with live organisms in an ethical manner, and I was also able to
                        refine my

                        Moreover, in Austin, I explored my interests in the healthcare field through various
                        internships
                        at
                        UT Austin’s medical school and its associated clinics. Specifically, I interned at UT Health
                        Austin's Mitchel and Shannon Wong Eye Institute, where I discovered my interest in
                        neuro-ophthalmology, a field I am hoping to pursue as a physician. Working with a variety of
                        patients in such clinical settings also helped me reinforce my desire to pursue a medical
                        degree.
                        Specifically, viewing the doctors I shadowed interact with their patients to create a
                        diagnosis
                        and
                        then treat them with tact and empathy confirmed that I hope to be in that position one day.

                        Currently, at UNC, I am involved in research at the <a

                        UNC’s
                        medical school, where I research the neural mechanisms of skilled motor control post-stroke
                        recovery
                        in mice using optogenetics. Finally, I am a member of Remote Area Medical (<a

                        of
                        underserved communities. Specifically, I am on their Community Host Group committee, where I
                        am
                        working towards establishing a local clinic in Chapel Hill with physicians and student
                        volunteers on
                        site. Our goals are to fundraise, network with physicians willing to volunteer their time,
                        and
                        communicate with RAM headquarters to achieve our longitudinal goal by 2027.
