             <p class="text-black p-8 bg-white text-1xl">Currently, I work as a paid undergraduate research assistant in the Hantman Lab at UNC Medicine's Neuroscience Center. Skillful movements contribute to the major functions of the brain, such as perception and manipulation of the world. Skill involves understanding the world, developing appropriate plans, converting those plans into appropriate motor commands, and adaptively reacting to feedback. Considering the range of possible actions and the complexity of musculoskeletal arrangements, skilled motor control is an amazing achievement of the nervous system. The myriad of these underlying operations is likely performed by a diverse set of neural circuits. By combining anatomy, physiology, and specific (genetic and temporal) manipulations, the lab aims to identify and understand the neural elements responsible for skillful motor control. Specifically, I am exploring neural mechanisms of post-stroke recovery (simulated via optogenetic interventions) in skilled motor control movement in model mice as observed via their performance on a reach and grab task.</p>

                    <p class="text-black p-8 bg-white text-1xl">As part of the IB Diploma Programme, I aimed to explore how communication via snails’ mucin trails influences trail-following behavior in the two species to determine whether pheromones influence mate and food-finding, as well as whether this behavior impacts species-specific survival success and aggregation.
                        Specifically, I posited the following research question: How does pheromone-based communication affect trail-following in Otala lactea and Bulimulus guadalupensis as measured by the number of snails that follow a mucin trail through a Y-maze over a three-hour period?</p>
