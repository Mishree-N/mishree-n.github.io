                        Neuroscience Centerwhere we research skillful movements which contribute to the major functions
                        of the brain, such as perception and manipulation of the world. Considering the range of
                        possible actions and the
                        complexity of musculoskeletal arrangements, skilled motor control is an amazing achievement of
                        the
                        nervous system. The myriad of these underlying operations is likely performed by a diverse set
                        of
                        neural circuits. By combining anatomy, physiology, and specific (genetic and temporal)
                        manipulations, the lab aims to identify and understand the neural elements responsible for
                        skillful
                        motor control. Specifically, I am exploring neural mechanisms of post-stroke recovery (simulated
                        via
                        optogenetic interventions) in skilled motor control movement in model mice as observed via their
                        performance on a reach and grab task.</p>

                        how communication via snails’ mucin trails influences trail-following behavior in the two
                        species to determine whether pheromones influence mate and food-finding, as well as whether this
                        behavior impacts species-specific survival success and aggregation.
                        Specifically, I posited the following research question: How does pheromone-based communication
                        affect trail-following in <span class="italic">Otala lactea</span> and <span
                            class="italic">Bulimulus guadalupensis</span> as measured by the number of

                        the efficacy of various contact lens cleaning solutions in eradicating bacterial growth.
                        Specifically, I posited the following research question: To what extent do various contact lens
                        solutions (saline, multipurpose solution, and hydrogen peroxide)
                        inhibit the number of colonies <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> grown on

                        novel Type 1 Secretion System (T1SS) developed for use in Gram-negative bacteria to induce the
                        secretion
                        of Eglin C, a pharmacologically active elastase inhibitor which has been shown to inhibit
                        matriptase, a protease correlated
                        with cancer progression that plays an essential role in the metastatic process of cancer cells
                        in multiple cancer pathways. My group's
                        aim was to achieve the large-scale secretion of Eglin C, which has become a major interest in
                        biotherapeutics for cancer. After achieving low-scale secretion over the span of a summer, we
                        presented our work UT Austin's poster symposium.
