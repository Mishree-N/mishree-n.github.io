                    <p class="text-black text-1xl">Currently, I work as a paid undergraduate research assistant
                        in the Hantman Lab at UNC Medicine's Neuroscience Center. Skillful movements contribute to the
                        major
                        functions of the brain, such as perception and manipulation of the world. Skill involves
                        understanding the world, developing appropriate plans, converting those plans into appropriate
                        motor
                        commands, and adaptively reacting to feedback. Considering the range of possible actions and the
                        complexity of musculoskeletal arrangements, skilled motor control is an amazing achievement of
                        the
                        nervous system. The myriad of these underlying operations is likely performed by a diverse set
                        of
                        neural circuits. By combining anatomy, physiology, and specific (genetic and temporal)
                        manipulations, the lab aims to identify and understand the neural elements responsible for
                        skillful
                        motor control. Specifically, I am exploring neural mechanisms of post-stroke recovery (simulated
                        via
                        optogenetic interventions) in skilled motor control movement in model mice as observed via their
                        performance on a reach and grab task.</p>

                    <p class="text-black text-1xl">As part of the IB Diploma Programme, I aimed to explore
                        how communication via snails’ mucin trails influences trail-following behavior in the two
                        species to determine whether pheromones influence mate and food-finding, as well as whether this
                        behavior impacts species-specific survival success and aggregation.
                        Specifically, I posited the following research question: How does pheromone-based communication
                        affect trail-following in <span class="italic">Otala lactea</span> and <span class="italic">Bulimulus guadalupensis</span> as measured by the number of
